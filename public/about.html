<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Averie Michel. I am from Oklahoma where I have stayed my whole life. In 2018 I graduated from high 
  school. In the same month that I graduated I recieved the news that I passed my State Board exams for cosmetology
  and Barbering. Shortly after I began my career in the beauty industry. I then started working for our local Smartstyle.
</p>

<p>Fast forward 1 year, this is when I decided to go on my own as an independant contractor. I worked 
  for myself while renting a space from a salon owner for another 3 years. This is when I took the time to focus
  on my skills, perfecting my service lists and pricing.
</p>

<p>Once I felt comfortable with my knowledge on the industry I decided to open my own salon. Through the trials and 
  tribulations this entailed I gained so much knowledge on how to run a succesful business. I now have a Full
  service salon "Eye Candy & Esthetics" located in Duncan, Oklahoma. I have 6 women that work for me and run their own
  individual businesses inside of mine.
</p>
<p> Thankfully, since my salon is a success I have the opportunity to use this as a passive income and take advantage of 
  the time I now have to further my education in a different direction. I have considered web development for a long time,
  now I have the opportunity to truly dedicate myself to obtaining this education. After just a few weeks I am so intrigued 
  and eager to continue learning and hopefully soon have a cereer in this field.
